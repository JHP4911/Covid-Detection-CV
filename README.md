Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease first originated in December 2919 from Wuhan, China and since then it has spread globally across the world affecting more than 200 countries.



### 1. Molecular tests:

They usually involve taking a sample from the back of the throat with a cotton swab. The doctor then sends the sample off for testing.The sample will undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This type of test detects signs of the virusâ€™s genetic material.

### 2. Serological tests:

These tests detect antibodies that the body produces to fight the virus. These antibodies are present in anyone who has recovered from COVID-19.The antibodies exist in blood and tissues throughout the body. A serological test usually requires a blood sample.

AI-powered analysis of chest scans has the potential to alleviate the growing burden on radiologists, who must review and prioritize a rising number of patient chest scans each day, experts say. And in the future, the technology might help predict which patients are most likely to need a ventilator or medication, and which can be sent home.


In this notebook , i have conducted an experiemnt leveraging chest x-ray scans and using Deep CNN nueral nets to perform automated diagnosis.

Grad-CAM for localising model predictions therby providing more insights to the model output.
